Notes: 
1. For extra info on "DESCRIPTION" column, please see "NOTES" column for relevant notes which can be found at the bottom of the page.
2. All features (not including "Subject" and "YActivities") are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
3. Please see "features_info.txt" for more information on the original data set columns, and "README.txt" for additional information.
4. Units are not applicable for any of the variables, as all measure variables have been normalized and Subject and YActivities do not have units of 	measurement.

A	These features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.  and filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Acceleration readings were separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. The body acceleration signal is obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration (measured in units of 'g').

B	Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity (radians/sec) were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.

C	The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

D	Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
